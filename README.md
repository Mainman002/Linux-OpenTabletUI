# Wacom-Bamboo-Settings-Gui
A Wacom Bamboo Pen Tablet Settings UI

[ Things To Install Before Running ]

Arch Linux = sudo pacman -S libwacom xf86-input-wacom

Ubuntu / Debian = sudo apt install libwacom xf86-input-wacom

also make sure to restart after installing so your tablet can be recognised by the ui

( currently this is using Godot 2.1.3 stable )

[ Stuff I want / need for the future ]

[] improve perforamcne and reduce cpu / ram usage by upgrading from godot to javascrip, C, C++, etc

[] add monitor draggable box for faster visual aid on viweport cursor limits

[] add tablet draggable box for fast and easy limits for pen locations on the tablet surface

[] add profile settings for fast switchable preferances

[] xfce, gnome, kde panel icon right clicking would show a list of features including

(disable tablet, pen pressure slider, show settings gui, quit program)

[] either add more tablet compatibility or make other standalone versions to reduce bloat
